The goal of this project is to build a simple Etch-a-Sketch program with JavaScript, HTML and CSS that takes user input to generate a grid of squares (up to a 100 squares per side), and when mouse passes over them they change colors leaving a trail through the grid.

I had a clear idea from the start how to tackle this project. Thinking about how to generate a grid of squares horizontally and vertically took me the most time, until I remembered the exercise from chapter 2 of the "Eloquent JavaScript" book where you have to generate a chessboard made from hashtags and spaces, and the key for solving that exercise was to use two loops, one nested inside the other.

Some of the things I learned:

- Creating, removing and appending elements to the DOM
- How to generate random RGB values
- Basic understanding of nested loops
